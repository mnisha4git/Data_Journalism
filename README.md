# D3.js - Data Visualization

## Project Description

In this project , I used d3.js to create a scatter plot. Circles , axis and axis labels were created based on data from 2014 census using d3.js. I added multiple dimensions to the scatter plot using d3 transitions to update data axis ,labels , axis ranges and tool tips.The Scatter plot provides comparison between data variables such as 'Healthcare vs. Poverty' and 'Household Income vs Obesity'.

Data is provided as a .csv file assets/data/data.csv.

CDN (Content Delivery Networks) links for d3.js , d3-tip.js and Bootstrap are included in index.html file.
'python -m http.server' command is run to bring up the visualization. This will host the page at 'localhost:8000' in the web browser.
